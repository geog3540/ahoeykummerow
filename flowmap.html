        <p class="card-text">Looking at my flow map of net family migration from 1887 to 1924, one of the most apparent states is Oklahoma. It had the largest net gain of families during this period, which is clear from the deep green choropleth shading and the large number of thick inward flow lines pointing toward it. Oklahoma’s black node is also large, reflecting its high total migration activity. This makes sense historically because, during this time, the U.S. opened up land in Oklahoma that was previously Native American Territory, and many families moved there to claim land and start new lives.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Alongside Oklahoma, other major attractors include California, Washington, and Idaho. These states are also shaded in green, showing strong net in-migration. Despite showing high net migration, California doesn’t have a node. Since I restricted the flow symbology to only show the strongest 80 migration paths, any state—like California—that wasn’t part of those top connections won’t have a node, even if it had notable overall migration. It’s also possible that while California had a high net gain of families (as shown by the green shading), the individual flows to and from it were more spread out or smaller in volume compared to the more concentrated flows in the central U.S.</p>

        <p class="card-text">States like Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, and much of the Southeast show the opposite pattern. They’re shaded pink, indicating net losses, and have small nodes, which means they sent out more families than they received and had lower total migration activity.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Most of the migration flows are oriented westward and southward. There’s a clear trend of families moving from the Northeast, Great Lakes, and Appalachian regions toward the West. This pattern matches the historical context of westward expansion, new agricultural opportunities, and land settlement programs in this period.</p>
